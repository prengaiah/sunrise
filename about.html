  <div class="about-body">
    <p>Please use this a starting point for you site. But remember, this would not have been possible without hundreds of Jekyll created sites running on GitHub Pages and elsewhere. I scrapped some of the good ones to come up with this design and code template.</p><br>
    <p>Show me some love by forking this repo and making it even more awesome. Also, If you <a href="https://twitter.com/its_param" target="_new">tweet</a> me about what you think of it, that would make my day.</p><br>
    <p>It all started when I was doing research for a talk at <a href="http://prototypecamp.com/" target="_new">Prototype Camp</a>. I understand what is Jekyll and knew how to use it. The message I wanted to convey is that other CMS sites will force you to mostly follow their way to get the full benefit of the CMS. With Jekyll, you don't have to. You can do whatever you want and if it can be converted to HTML, CSS, JS you are good to go. But the two popular options built on Jekyll are Jekyll Bootstrap or Octopress. Octopress <i>is</i> a CMS. It may not need a database, but it stil is a CMS. Jekyll Bootstrap is not a CMS, but it is a Ruby project whio's primary purpose is to get you started with you Jekyll. It's not suitable for a design based site creation.</p><br>
    <p>I didn't really had a template to showcase that met my expectations. So I created one. Its a blnk canvas, created with as little dependencies as possible. It for for the people who like to <a href="http://dolectures.com/lectures/do-things-the-long-hard-stupid-way/">do things the long, hard, stupid way</a>. </p><br><p>Hope you like it, use it and extend it.</p><br>
